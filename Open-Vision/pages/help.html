      <ul id="bullet_text">
        <li>Before you begin, place the video you wish to analyze in the video folder in this directory.
          <br>
          If you have multiple videos shot from the same camera/position you only need one for now.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Click on the 'LOAD NEW PROJECT' button and select the video from the previous step.
          <br>
          This will load the video onto the page so that you can accurately place the zone lines.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next click on the 'ADD ZONE' button.
          <br>
          This will initiate the drawing function in order to draw zone delineations.
          <br>
          To draw the zones, start by holding down the left mouse button in the starting location.
          <br>
          Move your cursor to the end location and release the mouse button.
          <br>
          Repeat these steps for the remainder of the zones.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next click on the 'ADD MASK' button.
          <br>
          This step is optional, but will help the accuracy and speed of the tracker.
          <br>
          To add a mask, left click and release at each vertex for the shape you wish to create.
          Try to add the vertices in a clockwise order.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next define the directions.
          <br>
          Click on the highlighted drop down box for 'NBR'. This will auto populate the rest of the
          movements based on your selection. This is not always accurate so make sure to check ALL the drop
          down boxes before moving on.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next save your work.
          <br>
          Click on the 'SAVE DETECTION ZONES' button.
          This will save a few .json files containing the data of your zones, mask, etc.
          You need to click 'allow multiple downloads' when the popup alert appears in the browser.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, we can run the tracker and get our Turning Movement Counts.
          <br>
          Click on the 'RUN TRACK' button.
          This will take a while, so feel free to come back at a later time to check the progress.
          <br></br>
