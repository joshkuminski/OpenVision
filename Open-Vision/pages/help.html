      <ul id="bullet_text">
        <li>Before you begin, place the video you wish to analyze in the <br> video folder in this directory.
          <br>
          If you have multiple videos shot from the same camera/position <br> you only need one for now.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Click on the 'LOAD NEW PROJECT' button and select the video <br> from the previous step.
          <br>
          This will load the video onto the page so that you can accurately <br> place the zone lines.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next click on the 'ADD ZONE' button.
          <br>
          This will initiate the drawing function in order to draw zone delineations.
          <br>
          To draw the zones, start by holding down the left mouse button in the <br>starting location.
          <br>
          Move your cursor to the end location and release the mouse button.
          <br>
          Repeat these steps for the remainder of the zones. <br> <br> <h4>The main zones should be assigned to numbers 1 - 4.
          If you use <br>'Secondary' zones these should start at 5.</h4>
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next click on the 'ADD MASK' button.
          <br>
          This step is optional, but will help the accuracy and speed of the tracker.
          <br>
          To add a mask, left click and release at each vertex for the shape you <br> wish to create.
          <br>
          Try to add the vertices in a clockwise order.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next define the directions.
          <br>
          Click on the highlighted drop down box for 'NBR'. This will auto populate <br>the rest of the
          movements based on your selection. This is not always <br> accurate so make sure to check
          ALL the drop down boxes before <br> moving on.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Next save your work.
          <br>
          Click on the 'SAVE DETECTION ZONES' button.
          This will save a few <br> .json files containing the  data of your zones, mask, etc.
          You need to <br>click 'allow multiple downloads' when the popup alert appears in the <br> browser.
          <br></br>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, we can run the tracker and get our Turning Movement Counts.
          <br>
          Click on the 'RUN TRACK LOCAL' or 'RUN TRACK CLOUD' button.
          <br>To run on you local machine, run the 'OV-track.bat' file. See the GitHub <br>repo for more information.
          This will take a while, so feel free to come <br>back at a later time to check the progress.
          The run on the Cloud, <br>the 'RUN TRACK CLOUD' button will take you to the Google Colab. page.<br>
          You need to create a directory in your Google Drive called <br>'Open-Vision/video'.
          Place the video files you wish to process in this <br>directory.
          Follow the instruction on Google Colab. to complete the process.
