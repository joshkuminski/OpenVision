# OpenVision
Object Detection and Tracking for Traffic Counts and Analytics.

This repository leverages the powerful capabilities of the [Yolov7_StrongSORT_OSNet](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov7_StrongSORT_OSNet) framework. Included is a user-friendly web application that allows users to effortlessly define movements and count vehilcles. A simple algorithm is employed to count the vehicles in 15-minute increments, and object detection is achieved through the use of Yolov7 while tracking is achieved via StongSORT. 

# Background
A Turning Movement Count, is commonly used in traffic engineering to model intersections and optimize signal timing.
