# OpenVision
Object Detection and Tracking for Traffic Counts and Analytics.

This repository leverages the powerful capabilities of the [Yolov7_StrongSORT_OSNet](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov7_StrongSORT_OSNet) framework. Included is a user-friendly web application that allows users to effortlessly define movements and count vehilcles. A simple algorithm is employed to count the vehicles in 15-minute increments, and object detection is achieved through the use of [Yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) while tracking is achieved via [StongSORT](https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT) which combines motion and appearance information based on [OSNet](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid). 

# Background
A Turning Movement Count, is commonly used in traffic engineering to model intersections and optimize signal timing.

# Instructions
For More detailed instructions see [OpenVision]()
1. Install [python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/):
